Thursday
===

Thursday is a starter theme based on Underscores and Sakura CSS. 

It's purpose is to give Clients and Content Editors an attractive but not distracting site to produce content, while the Development team works on site features and design.

Thursday is my first entry into my series, WordPress Theme Thursdays, where I release a WordPress project every week.
